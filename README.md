# Data-Processing-Pipeline
Process data iteratively - Similar to Unix pipes for grep

Makes use of regular expressions to serach files for text patterns. Reads from a file to search folders/ directries.

Processing speed leaves much to be desired, but takes very little memory as each file is part of an iterator and then discared.
